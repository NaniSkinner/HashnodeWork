I never imagined that at 35, I’d be sitting at my desk learning to code, with lines of JavaScript staring back at me. Yet here I am, knee-deep in the world of Web3 and frontend engineering, wondering how I got here—and why it feels like exactly the right place to be.

This leap wasn’t something I planned years in advance. It came from a growing curiosity, a quiet challenge I set for myself, and a belief in one of my favorite Naval Ravikant quotes: *“Play long-term games with long-term people. You only have one life. Why not do it all?”* That last part has stuck with me. Why not do it all?

### **Curiosity and the Future**

The truth is, the world is changing fast. Web3, blockchain, decentralization—these aren’t just buzzwords. They’re shaping the way we work, connect, and live. The more I read about this space, the more curious I became. What will my role be in this future? Could I contribute to this movement, not just as a spectator but as someone building within it?

Curiosity became my compass. It pulled me toward Web3 like a magnet, urging me to ask questions, explore possibilities, and try something I’d never done before. It’s easy to feel intimidated by how much there is to learn, but there’s also something liberating about starting fresh. Every small piece of progress feels like a revelation, and with each step, the future doesn’t just feel exciting—it feels possible.

### **For My Children**

A big part of this journey isn’t just about me—it’s about my kids. As a mother, I’ve always believed in leading by example. When I was homeschooling them, I was their guide, their teacher, and their cheerleader. Now, as they step into school, I want to be a different kind of guide: someone who shows them that learning doesn’t end when you reach adulthood.

I think about how I want them to approach their lives—with curiosity, courage, and a belief that it’s okay to start over at any point. By embracing this challenge at 35, I hope I’m teaching them that growth isn’t something to be afraid of. It’s something to pursue, even when it’s hard, even when it feels risky.

More than anything, I want them to see that reinvention is part of life. Whether they want to be artists, engineers, or something entirely unexpected, I want them to know that the journey doesn’t have to follow a straight line. And that it’s okay—even wonderful—to surprise yourself.

### **Why Not Do It All?**

At 35, I could have stayed comfortable. But comfort doesn’t challenge us, and it doesn’t change us. Naval’s words remind me that life isn’t meant to be lived in silos. We don’t have to be just one thing or follow just one path. We can explore, experiment, and grow in ways we never imagined.

Starting this new career is my way of answering that call. It’s scary, sure, but it’s also thrilling. And as I navigate this new world, I’m learning that the scariest leaps often lead to the most rewarding journeys.

So here I am—mother, learner, coder, and explorer—writing my own story in the spaces between all these roles. Why not do it all? After all, we only get one life.
