### Introduction: The Winds of Change

For the past eight years, homeschooling was our thing. It was messy and magical—a whirlwind of Montessori projects, spontaneous geography lessons during road trips, and the occasional “math happens best in pajamas” day. But now, here I am, getting the kids ready to drop them off at school.

We live in a small town outside the bustling city of Bogotá, Colombia, where we found a beautiful little schoolhouse. It’s the kind of place that helps children fall in love with learning, encouraging them to discover who they are and what they want to be when they grow up. Somewhere along the way, things started to shift. The kids began craving new adventures, new friends, and new challenges. And, honestly? I realized I was ready for a challenge of my own.

So here we are, stepping into a new chapter. My kids are diving into the school projects, and I’m diving headfirst into Web3 and frontend engineering. It’s a little nerve-wracking, sure. But with my husband as my mentor and biggest cheerleader, I’ve realized this change isn’t just for them. It’s for me too.

### Adjusting to the New Routine

The first week felt… surreal. The mornings were quieter—eerily so. No rush to pull out materials for the day’s lesson, no chatter about which project we’d dive into first. Instead, I found myself packing lunchboxes and walking them to the school gate, waving as they disappeared into their new world.

At home, the silence felt unfamiliar. I kept catching myself glancing at the clock, half-expecting them to barge into the kitchen asking for a snack or to help solve a problem. But slowly, I started to settle into the quiet. I reclaimed parts of my day that I hadn’t realized were missing—uninterrupted time to focus, to learn, and to start working toward my own goals.

Of course, it hasn’t been without its challenges. Dropping off the kids and transitioning straight into “Web3 learner mode” is easier said than done. There are still errands, emails, and the occasional sick child. But I’m learning to embrace the ebb and flow of this new rhythm.

It’s a work in progress, but every day feels like a small victory. My kids are thriving in their new environment, and I’m finding my groove in this fresh chapter of life.

### How This Fuels My Career Goals

When I started this journey into Web3 and frontend engineering, I wasn’t entirely sure how I’d manage it all—or if I could even do it. But taking this leap has been on my heart for a long time: a chance to focus on personal growth, dive into the rapidly evolving Web3 community, and build a career in tech.

With the kids now immersed in their new school routine, I’ve found the space to fully embrace the learner mindset. I’ve set up my workspace, joined online coding communities, and even started tackling my first small projects. At first, each line of code felt impossible to understand. But as I practice, those lines begin to make sense—slowly but surely building something bigger: a future where I’m not just a mom cheering from the sidelines but a professional pursuing her own passions and contributing meaningfully to an industry I’m genuinely excited about.

Having the support of my husband, who’s both a mentor and my biggest cheerleader, has been invaluable. He’s helped me navigate the overwhelming world of Web3—guiding me through jargon-filled rabbit holes and reminding me that every expert was once a beginner.

What excites me most is the example this sets for my kids. As they watch me learn, struggle, and grow, I hope they see that it’s never too late to chase a dream, embrace a new challenge, or reinvent yourself. It’s not just about learning to code—it’s about showing them that growth is always possible, no matter where you start.

### Conclusion: A New Chapter, Together

This transition from homeschooling to traditional school has been a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, uncertainty, and everything in between. But as we’ve settled into this new rhythm, I’ve realized that change, while challenging, can open doors to growth for everyone in the family.

For my kids, it’s a chance to explore new friendships, develop their unique talents, and thrive in an environment that encourages their individuality. For me, it’s a chance to step into a rapidly evolving world, to learn and build, and to prove to myself that it’s never too late to start something new.

We’re all adjusting in our own ways, finding our footing in this new chapter. And while there are still bumps along the way—busy schedules, moments of doubt, and the occasional bedtime meltdown—there’s also a growing sense of hope and possibility.

This journey isn’t just mine; it’s ours. Together, we’re growing, learning, and creating a life that’s richer for the risks we’ve taken. I can’t wait to see where it takes us next.
