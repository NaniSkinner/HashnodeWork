As you might know by now, one of my favorite parts about working in Web3 and attending events like EthDenver is getting to meet incredible people who inspire curiosity. Recently, I had the pleasure of chatting with Pauline, the DevRel at Wormhole, and our conversation sparked my interest: What exactly is Wormhole, and how does it contribute to blockchain interoperability?

### So, What is Wormhole?

Wormhole is a decentralized cross-chain messaging protocol that lets different blockchains, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain, communicate seamlessly. It works thanks to a group of 19 validators called Guardians, who securely verify and relay messages across chains, eliminating the need for centralized exchanges.

### Why Wormhole Matters

The blockchain world is still pretty fragmented. Wormhole is changing this by enabling decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts on different blockchains to interact with each other effortlessly. This opens up amazing opportunities for developers looking to build multichain apps, and makes life easier for users who want a smooth, integrated Web3 experience.
