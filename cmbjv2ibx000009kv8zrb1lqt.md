If you’ve ever spent hours studying something only to forget it the next day… you’re not alone. And no, your brain isn’t broken. It’s just wired for something different: **curiosity.**

As someone who spent over a decade working closely with how the brain learns through Montessori education and hands-on child development, I’ve seen it over and over again:

You can spend days trying to teach a child the color yellow. You hold up yellow toys. You sing yellow songs. You point to bananas, lemons, and the sun. And then… crickets. They smile, but they don’t *really* get it.

Then one day, seemingly out of nowhere, the child becomes *interested* in colors. Maybe it’s a red ball, a blue truck, or a green crayon that grabs their attention. Within moments, they’ve absorbed **all** the primary colors—effortlessly. Why? Because the brain was finally *ready*. Curiosity had flipped the switch.

## **What Montessori Taught Me About the Mind**

Montessori education isn’t about forcing information into a child. It’s about creating an environment where their **natural interests** guide what and how they learn. We observe, we prepare, and we *wait* for that spark.

When curiosity lights up, the brain goes into high gear. It becomes alert, open, and primed to form connections. That’s when learning sticks, not when we push, but when the learner leans in.

And here’s the thing: **this doesn’t change as we grow up.** Adults learn the same way. You might think you’re too busy or not “disciplined enough” to keep up with new tech or AI trends. But maybe the real problem is that we’re approaching learning the wrong way—**backwards.**

## **Why I Created Minds, Matcha & Machines**

As I transitioned from being an educator to exploring Web3 and AI, I found myself craving *a different kind of learning experience.* Something small. Something digestible. Something that would let my brain *decide* when to go deeper. That’s what *Minds, Matcha & Machines* is all about.

Each video in this series gives you one tiny sip of a big concept in Web3, AI, or the future of tech. Not a lecture. Not a course. Just a spark. And then *you* decide what to do with it.

If your brain says, “That’s interesting,” I’ll always link to places where you can dive deeper, on your own time, in your own way.

## **Follow the Spark**

We live in the era of information overload. You could learn almost *anything* right now… But the trick is to **learn what your brain is ready for.** The next time a post, video, or thread catches your attention, ask yourself:

*Is this sparking something in me?* If yes—follow it. Even for 10 minutes. You’ll remember what you learn far better than anything you tried to memorize while bored or distracted. *Minds, Matcha & Machines* is my digital learning journal. But it’s also yours, if you want it.
